# actr.toml — linked runtime configuration for the Kotlin Android client.
#
# Mirrors the Swift EchoApp: the client uses ActrNode.linked() and does NOT use
# `actr build`. This file is read directly as runtime configuration, so package,
# binary, and build sections are intentionally omitted. Package identity is
# declared in manifest.toml (read by resolveActorType()).
#
# The Android emulator reaches the host's localhost via 10.0.2.2.
